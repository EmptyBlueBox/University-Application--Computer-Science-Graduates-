# 出国申请总结（Computer Science）

## 第四篇：了解海外高校

英文版（中文版在后面）

This article is originally written in English, and I believe you can understand it easily.
I strongly recommend you read the English version as it's more exhaustive.


Besides, you do need to search Google **in English** for information about colleges, schools, and programs. Although Chinese websites like Zhihu, Douban, 1 Point 3 Acres can be helpful sometimes, generally you had better rely more on English sites.

Learning about overseas universities can be divided into several stages. Let's discuss them one by one.

### Stage 1: What Schools Are There?

In August of last year, when starting preparing for the application, my friend asked me, "I have no idea what schools are there. I don't even know what countries I should pay attention to. How can I get to know necessary information efficiently?"

Well, that's rather common. After all, those schools lie in countries that few of us have lived in for a long time.

Of course, start doing the following things as early as possible. It won't be too early even if you are just a freshman.

The process of collecting related information seems formidable, but there's no need to worry.

For a (relatively) complete list of top universities in CS, see [csrankings](http://csrankings.org/).

**Notes for csrankings**:

1. Colleges are ranked simply by ***the number of publications of top conferences/journals***. As a result, colleges with a large number of **faculty** are favored; that's why CMU is ranked No.1, while the rank of Caltech is significantly lower than the real situation.
2. Also due to the ranking algorithm, research fields where publications of top conferences/journals are easier like AI contributes more to the rank.
3. Once again, because of the algorithms, papers of high quality and their low-quality counterparts aren't distinguished.
4. Someone may ask, "now that the rank itself isn't reasonable enough, can I manually rank them with the formula *publications/faculty*?" Unfortunately, this method also has its weaknesses, i.e., it doesn't take into account the average number of students per teacher; in other words, if a teacher can hire more students in a school, then this ratio will be likely to increase.
5. Common sense does help, e.g., it will tell you Caltech does well in CS, and Princeton is good at some fields, although these aren't recognized by csrankings.

With this, I believe you are able to figure out why PKU and THU are ranked so high now.

### Tips

Create a spreadsheet (excel file) to record the information you have found. This is very, very helpful during the application!

## From Schools to Programs

At the end of the day, what you apply for is not schools, but programs, so the next step is **finding programs on the official websites**.

This is indeed very easy. Just type keywords in Google. For example, "Stanford CS master".

Except for CMU, generally each school has no more than one CS master program and this are often called MSCS.
Few schools like UIUC have a professional CS master program (MCS), and a research-oriented one (MSCS).
Some schools like USC and NEU have an aligned program for those without a bachelor's degree in CS.

All in all, as long as your target is clear enough, you only need to apply for one program per school except for CMU.

The CS programs of CMU are a little complex, and I will introduce them in later articles.

At the moment, at least 40 schools and 50 programs are on my list.

## The First Filter

Currently, there're too many schools on your list. Therefore, the next step is to filter out programs roughly.

Key factors to consider during this rough filtering:

1. Course-based or thesis-based. This is the **primary** one!!!
2. Program duration. For me, I only consider ones that last for more than one year. Typically, CS programs (for those with a bachelor's degree in CS) in the US last for one year plus one term. In schools with 3 terms a year, a term is roughly 3 months long; while in schools with 2 terms a year, a term is roughly 4 months long. Thus, these programs typically last for 15 or 16 months. Stanford is an exception and its CS master program last for 2 years.
3. Courses. This can be delayed to later filters. Personally, I don't like programs with a lot of business courses.

After this filter, there're no more than 30 programs left on my list (I also remove some schools that aren't competitive enough).

## Stratification

If your common sense is powerful enough, this step will not be difficult at all for you.

Stratification can be carried out from several perspectives.

### Simplest One: Other's Stratification

There're some good articles on 1 Point 3 Acres and Zhihu in which some past applicants share their stratifications.

### How High Is the Bar of Admission?

Although it's not always true, generally speaking, the higher the bar of admission is, the better the program.

As a Chinese student, find this information on Chinese websites. Just type keywords in Google (Baidu may also work, but I have never tried that myself) like "CMU MSCS 录取数据".

### Study Experience

You can find some articles on personal experience written by students of a specific program. Find them on websites like Zhihu on your own! They may also talk about something like the employment of graduates and courses.

Based on the above factors, you can stratify the candidate programs into 3 to 5 tiers. You can also ask some senior students for their suggestions.

***Notes***
We aren't currently talking about choosing which program to apply, although this article does prepare some foundations for that.

### Further Filtering

I will discuss this in later articles.

Now that there aren't too many programs left, so choose some of them and find more information about them!

For example, search for their respective curriculum and course list, and you will know more about CS programs!

### Where to Go

Some key topics in later articles:

1. Get to know courses.
2. Get to know labs and faculty.
3. How to choose schools?

了解海外高校分几个阶段，以下逐一讨论。

## Stage 1：有哪些高校？

去年八月，也正是申请季之初，朋友问我，“我不知道该报什么学校，我甚至不知道该关注哪些国家，如何才能快速了解必要的信息呢？”

别慌，这很正常。毕竟，那是其他国家的学校。（当然，还是早点开始了解好，即便大一，也不算早）。

收集信息的过程听着很累，但是其实没什么需要担心的。

[csrankings](http://csrankings.org/)相对完整的学校列表可以参考这个。

**csrankings有关的一些注记**：

1. 学校排名仅参考顶会、顶刊的论文数量。所以，faculty多的学校有优势（CMU典型），但是Caltech就很吃亏。
2. 由于这个排名算法，AI这种容易发paper的领域对学校的排名的贡献更大。
3. 还是因为这个算法，好论文和水论文被同等看待。
4. 也许有人问，“既然它的排名不完全靠谱，能不能用**论文数/faculty数量**自己排个名呢？”很遗憾，这个方法也有问题，师生比低的学校在这个标准里有优势。
5. 常识很管用，比如说，常识会告诉你，Caltech CS很强，Princeton的CS在某些方面很强，尽管这两个学校在csrankings排名不高。

现在，你肯定也知道为什么北大和清华的排名这么高了。

### 建议

建个excel表格，申请季很有用！

## 从学校到项目

我们最终申请的是项目，而非学校。所以下一步，你需要在学校官网找到对应的项目。

实际上这非常简单，Google搜关键词就行，例如，"Stanford CS master"。

除了CMU，只要目标明确，其他学校一般就一个CS项目需要操心（硕士、博士均是如此，详见英文版）。

到这一步，我的表上有至少40个学校和50个项目。

## 第一个filter

项目太多了，现在需要粗略过滤。

过滤的关键因素：

1. 授课型or学术型。这是最重要的因素！
2. 项目时长。（具体参见英文版）
3. 课程。这可以后续选校的时候再细看。

现在，我的列表上剩下不超过30个项目。

## 分层

只要常识足够强大，分层超简单。

分层可以从多个角度进行

### 最简单的方式：看看前人怎么做

一亩三分地和知乎上有一些很不错的文章，是当年的申请者讲自己如何分层。

### bar有多高

尽管bar和项目的水平并不必然正相关，但是，总体上相关性还是很高。

作为中国学生，这个地方还是查中文网站吧，外国人的bar对我们的适用性很有限。这一步也简单，例如，Google搜"CMU MSCS 录取数据"。

### 学习体验

知乎上经常能看到项目的学生写的学习体验，有时候他们还会介绍课程和就业等等。

基于上述因素，把项目分为3-5层。最好再找学长学姐要写建议。

***注意***
现在说的并不是选校，但是这些内容是选校的基础。

### 进一步的filter

后续文章会进一步介绍。

现在剩下的项目不算多，挑几个感兴趣的了解一下吧！

### 下一步

后续的文章包括但不限于这些重要的话题：

1. 了解课程
2. 了解实验室和faculty（这个我懂得不够多，但是还是可以说一点）
3. 选校
